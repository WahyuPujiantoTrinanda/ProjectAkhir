<a name="team"></a>
## Team Features
The team features are useful to share requests with team by saving data in git project.

**WARNING**: The **Environment** file which stores the secrets also saved in the same git folder, see **Note: 1** below.

Integrate with the Git project is now supported, 2 vscode settings options provided
1. **Load From Project**: select this option when you like to spilt data per project, it will create `thunder-tests` folder in workspace. This loads the data when you open the project in vscode.
   * (Optional) Now supports relative path to workspace directory. Use setting `Workspace Relative Path` to specify the relative path.
   * Make sure the `Workspace Relative Path` setting is **Workspace** setting not **User** setting.
   * Example 1: Relative Path to save in child folder of workspace is `FolderName` or `Child/FolderName`
   * Example 2: Relative Path to save in Parent folder of workspace is `../`
2. **Custom Location**: select this option when you like save all the data in one location, enter the full folder path to save the data.
   * Now supports relative path to Home directory. use **$HOME** prefix e.g `$HOME/Documents/ProjectName`
* Note 1: **Environment file**: if you dont want to save environment file to git server, use **.gitignore** to ignore the file thunderEnvironment.db
* Note 2: **Files changes** are not detected by the extension yet, if you pulled changes from git, click **Reload** option from collection Tab to update data.
* Note 3: Please **restart vscode** after updating settings.

<a name="testing"></a>
## Scriptless Testing
![](https://github.com/rangav/thunder-client-support/blob/master/images/thunder-client-tests.png?raw=true)

* We need to write a lot of boilerplate code in Postman and other clients to do basic testing using scripting like status code equal 200. So I implemented GUI based tests, where you select couple of dropdowns to do most standard tests very easily without any scripting knowledge.

<a name="setenv"></a>
## Set Environment Variable
Setting environment variables is supported in the Tests tab. Follow the steps below:
 * Create an environment first from the Env tab if it's not already created.
 * In the Tests tab, select the `Set Env Variable` dropdown option. (The action will automatically become `setTo`.)
 * Enter the appropriate source of variable value in the left input box:
   * **Header:** Enter `header.headerName` where `headerName` is the response header name.
   * **Cookie:** Enter `cookie.cookieName` where `cookieName` is the response cookie name.
   * **JSON Response:** Enter `json.propertyName` where `propertyName` is the JSON key in the response body.
   * **Text Response:** Enter the `text` keyword. This sets the entire response body to the variable.
 * In the value input, enter a variable name in the `{{variableName}}` format.
   * When it matches a variable name in Env, it will turn **green**. If the variable doesn't exist, it will be created.
 * Now execute the request. You will see the variable value set in the Env tab.
   * If you don't see the change in the Env tab, close and re-open the tab to refresh it.
 <a name="scope"></a>
 #### Set Env with Scope
 * You can use scope to control which environment variable to set the value explicitly
 * To set variable in **local** environment use `{{variable, local}}`
 * To set variable in **global** environment use `{{variable, global}}`
 * To set variable in **active** environment use `{{variable, active}}`
 
<a name="auth"></a>
## Auth
* OAuth 2.0 when grant type is **Authorization Code** the **callback url** needs to be entered into your oauth server trusted redirect url list.
* OAuth authentication credentials are sent **via header or body**, please select appropriate one based on your server requirement.

* ### Manual SSL Certificates
  * Provide ssl certificate paths for auth, using relative path to workspace or absolute paths. 
  * Use the **Certificates** vscode setting, see example below
  ```json
  "thunder-client.certificates": [
          {
              "host": "thunderclient.io",
              "certPath": "ssl/cert.pem",
              "keyPath": "ssl/keyfile.key",
              "pfxPath": "ssl/pfx.p12",
              "passphrase": "test"
          },
          {
              "host": "localhost:8081",
              "pfxPath": "/Users/test/Documents/ssl/pfx.p12",
              "passphrase": "test"
          },
          {
              "host": "testing.com",
              "certPath": "ssl/cert.pem",
              "keyPath": "ssl/keyfile.key"
          },
      ]
  ```
    

<a name="variables"></a>
## System Variables
The system variables are useful to generate random/dynamic data for use in request query params or body. The format is `{{#variableName}}`
* {{#guid}} - generates random uuid
* {{#string}} - generates random string
* {{#number}} - generates random number between 1 to 1000000
  * Custom Range: use `{{#number, min, max}}`, e.g: `{{#number, 100, 999}}`
* {{#email}} - generates random email
* {{#date}} - generates date timestamp
  * Custom date format: use `{{#date, 'YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss:fff'}}`, the format should be in single quote.
* {{#dateISO}} - generates date ISO format
